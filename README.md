# Space Quiz

## Description
- At the start of the challenge a webpage containing the framework for a quiz was provided. The task set was to construct a quiz that included clickable button, question feedback, and a highscore page that appears after a user won. 
- This type of program is a simple and fun quiz that anyone can play to expand their space knowledge. Users will get feedback in real time when they select an answer and the program will inform the user on whether they were correct or not. In addition, user can save their highscore in local storage. This means that users can compete with each other to try and obtain the highest score.
- this project I expanded my knowledge of javascript greatly. This project was by far the most complex so far, the logic needed to render each question involved researching for loops and expanding my knowledge on them. By far the most valuable take away from this challenge was learning to use local storage to render pre-saved highscores.

##Usage
- This webpage is designed to produce a quiz that users can play to expand their knowledge about space. The user can play the quiz and receive feedback about their answers so they know if they got the question right or wrong. Once the user finishes the quiz they are redirected back to the start screen page, meaning they can replay the quiz and try to improve their score!
- When a user presses the start screen page a timer begins. The score for this quiz is based on this timer, so the score at the end is the time it takes for the user to finish the quiz. For each wrong answer 20 seconds is deducted from the time.
